====

=== Viewing Help : `help`
Lists useful information such as the commands available.

==== The Command
Format: `help`

=== Adding a Person: `add`
The most basic functionality of Contact'em, which adds a contact to the address book.

==== The Command
Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [b/BIRTHDAY] [f/FACEBOOK] [t/TAG]...`

`add` is the command word, and the other `parameters` (e.g. n/NAME) are details of the contact to be added.

`Prefixes`, e.g. `n/`, `p/`, are required before typing in the required field.

After entering the command, the application will also respond with the details of the added contact, for your reference.
Do refer to `section 2.2.3` below to see recommended actions if contact was added with errors.

==== Usage Examples

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John Street, block 123, #01-01` +
Adds a contact `named John Doe`, with `phone number: 98765432`, `email address: johnd@example.com`, and `address: John Street, block 123, #01-01`.

* `add n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Betsy road, block 456, #01-02 p/98765432 t/friend`

Adds a contact `named Betsy Crowe`, with `phone number: 98765432`, `email address: betsycrowe@example.com`, and `address: Betsy Road, block 456, #01-02`.
Also tags contact with `friend`.


[TIP]
Optional parameters are in square brackets, such as Birthday, Facebook and Tag, are optional when first adding a contact.

[NOTE]
A contact can be added with any number of tags, including 0.

[TIP]
The order of parameters entered does not matter.

[WARNING]
However, the command word `add` must be in front.

[WARNING]
Prefixes are necessary before the corresponding fields, e.g. **n/** John will work, but just entering John will not.

==== Contact Added With Error
If contact was added in error, or with errors, user can `undo`, `edit`, or `delete` it. +

* To undo, enter `undo` (recommended). +

* To edit, refer to `section 2.4` below (recommended for experienced users). +

* To delete, refer to `section 2.8` below (least recommended). +

==== Common Problems

1. Missing required fields +
Compulsory fields to be entered are
`*_name, address, phone number and email address._*`

2. Missing prefixes

3. Duplicate contacts +
If there is a duplicate contact, Contact'em will not allow the addition

=== Listing All Contacts : `list`

Displays all contacts in the address book.

==== The Command
Format: `list`

[TIP]
If you are searching for particular contact(s), it is recommended to use `find` or `findtags` instead, see details at #....#

==== Common Problems

1. No contacts in list +
Import contacts or start adding them! +

[WARNING]
If this occurred due to an accidental `clear` command, it is recommended to `undo` as soon as possible, #without closing the application as data will be permanently lost after otherwise.#

=== Editing a person : `edit`

Edits the information of an existing contact. +

==== The Command

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

==== Examples

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` +
Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` +
Edits the name of the 2nd person to `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

[NOTE]
`INDEX` refers to the number on the contact to be edited in the displayed list.
#refer to picture below, to be added!#

[NOTE]
You can specify any number of fields (in square brackets), but naturally at least one field must be changed for it to be a valid command.

[NOTE]
Unspecified fields will be unchanged.

[WARNING]
In this version, editing of tags changes the entire list of tags to the new one, that is, the previous list of tags the person had will be completely wiped if tags are edited.
Therefore, to add tags, user must include previous tags.

[TIP]
To remove tags, simply include the field `t/`.

[TIP]
If user wishes to revert the edit, simply type in the `undo` command **without closing the app**


==== Common Problems
1. Not providing the right prefix/field +
The field entered must be suitable for the prefix, for example, entering a phone number with the address field prefix `a/` will not pass.

2. Old tags were unintentionally removed +
Use the `undo` command to revert changes.

3. Not entering the correct `index` +
Ensure that the `index` entered is correct, or it may cause unintentional changes to another contact. +
[NOTE]
`Index` is the #currently displayed# number corresponding to the contact, which may differ if the current displayed list has been filtered.


#Feature to edit tags specifically coming in future updates!#

=== Locating persons by name: `find`
`Find` contacts whose names contain any of the given keywords. +

==== The Command
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

==== Examples
* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having names `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`.

[TIP]
Keywords are not case-sensitive

[TIP]
Order of keywords does not matter

[NOTE]
As long as a single word in a contact's name matches any of the keywords, that contact will be displayed

[NOTE]
Only full words will be matched, for example, finding `Han` will not match `Hans`. To search for a contact without specifying the full word, refer to `EasyFind` in the section below.

==== EasyFind

Auto updates the display when user enters an alphabet with the `find` command.
Finds persons whose names contain any of the alphabets sequence in the command box constantly having the user to input `enter`.

****
* The search will be case insensitibe. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`
* The alphabetic sequence must start with the name of the contacts. e.g. `hans` will match `handsome` but not `irhans`
* Different alphabetic sequences will be separated by a `space`.
* Persons matching at least one of the alphabetic sequence seperated by spaces will be returned. e.g. `Hans Ma` will return `Hans Gruber`, `May Tan`
* When the search results displays `no results`, the particular alphabetic sequence will not display any contacts even when the user continues inputing new characters.
****

Examples:

 * `find Alex` +
 Returns `Alex` and `Alexandra`
 * `find Alexan` +
 Returns `Alexandra`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +
Returns any person having starting alphabets `Betsy`, `Tim`, or `John`


=== Locating persons by tag name: `findtags`

Finds persons who have tags matching any of the given keywords. +

==== The Command
Format: `findtags KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` +

==== Examples
* `findtags friends` +
Returns any contact tagged `friends`.

* `findtags friends colleagues schoolmates` +
Returns any person having any of the tags `friends`, `colleagues`, and/or `schoolmates`.

[TIP]
You can substitute the command `findtags` with `findtag` or `ft`.

[NOTE]
The search is **not** case-sensitive.

[NOTE]
The order of the keywords does not matter.

[NOTE]
Only full words will be matched. For example, `fri` will **not** match `friends`.

[NOTE]
Contact with at least one of the specified tag keywords will be displayed

==== Note on singular and plural tenses
The search will attempt to be more lenient with singular and plural tenses.

For example: +

* `friend` will return contacts with either tag `friend` or `friends`. +
* `colleagues` will return contacts with either tag `colleague` or `colleagues`.

However, this may not always be correct for words where plural and singular differs not only by a single letter 's'.
Searching by tag `family` will attempt to find contacts with tags `family` and `familyS` instead of `families`.
Therefore, the onus is still on the user to specify the spelling of the tags.

=== List tags : `listtags` +
`coming in v1.3`

Lists all existing tags in the App +

==== The Command
Format: `listtags`

[TIP]
Listing all tags is designed to help you choose which tags to specify when using `findtags`.

=== Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book. +

==== The Command
Format: `delete INDEX`

==== Examples

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

[NOTE]
`INDEX` refers to the number on the contact to be edited in the displayed list.
#refer to picture below, to be added!#

[TIP]
If wrong person was deleted, **`undo` immediately without exiting the application!**

==== Common Problems
1. Not entering the correct `index` +
Ensure that the `index` entered is correct, or it may cause unintentional changes to another contact. +

[NOTE]
`Index` is the #currently displayed# number corresponding to the contact, which may differ if the current displayed list has been filtered.


=== Selecting a person : `select`

Selects the person identified by the index number used in the last person listing. +

==== The Command
Format: `select INDEX`

==== Usage Examples
* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` +
`select 1` +
Selects the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

==== More Information

[NOTE]
If Facebook page of the contact is not stored in the application, the default Facebook homepage will be loaded instead.

==== Common Problems

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the address book to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +

==== The Command
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

==== Usage Examples

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

==== Common Problems
1. Trying to `Undo` commands that cannot be undone, for example trying to undo a `find`. +
The commands that can be undone are `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`. +
However, reverting find commands can still be done, by entering the search command with the previous criteria.

2. No commands to undo because application was closed. +
When the application is closed, the command history is deleted and not stored. Therefore, the application will not be able to know which command to undo. +
It is therefore recommended to undo any changes needed before closing the application.

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +

==== The Command
Format: `redo`

==== Usage Examples

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book. +

==== The Command
Format: `clear`

==== Notes on Usage
If `cleared` was used unintentionally, it is recommended to immediate enter undo. DO NOT close the application as data will be irreversibly removed.

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +

==== The Command
Format: `exit`

[TIP]
Alternatively, you can exit by clicking on the RED X at the top right of the Application to close (for Windows)

[NOTE]
#DO NOT# exit the application if you still have errors left to `undo` as command history is deleted when the application closes.

=== Saving the data

Address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.
