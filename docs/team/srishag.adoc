== Project: Contact'em
Contactâ€™em is a desktop address book application, and the user interacts with it through typing commands into the application.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Birthday attribute for Person

==== Justification

It is crucial that we remember the special day of the people who are important in our life.
The Birthday attribute helps users to remember the birthday of contacts and make this data more accessible.
However, it remains an optional field to ensure that a random date is not added when the birthday of a contact is
not known to the user. It also checks that the date entered is valid.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

//PR for DG (Birthday) yet to be merged

=== Enhancement Added: Send Email

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=gmail]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

The main intention of this enhancement is to utilise the email attribute added to person and contact them.
We used the Gmail API as this works well together with the `import`, `sync` and `export` commands.


=== Enhancement Added: Add Task

==== Justification

We wanted Contact'em to be more than just an place to store contacts.
Here we add the ability to add tasks into a separate list of tasks, each with their own Header, Description and Deadline.

=== Enhancement Added: Edit Task

==== Justification

It is common for tasks to change, more or less things to include, different deadlines, etc.
Editing a task is crucial for any user. Simply deleting and adding it again with different parameters is just not practical.

=== Enhancement Added: Delete Task

==== Justification

Deleting a task is crucial to indicate a completed, cancelled or even a task passed on to someone else.
As long as it's off the task list of the user, we want it to be removed from the task list on Contact'em.
